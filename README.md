# The Sequence Game

The Sequence Game (as I've been calling this application for now) is a [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)-type game, but with numbers 游뱁

(I must also say that the design and features were 99% inspired by [Termo](https://term.ooo) - the brazilian version of Wordle.)

The purpose here is just to practice my coding skills, but make yourself at home! 仇벒잺

You can play it [here](https://thesequencegame.vercel.app).

## Features

**游릴 Everyday a new game!** <br>
Using Notion to store the sequences, whoever plays the game that day will have the same sequence to guess.

**游릴 Continue where you left off!** <br>
Saving your stage to local storage ensures that, if you ever need to take a break, when you come back you'll continue from your last attempt.

**游릴 Keep track of your stats!**<br>
Again making use of local storage, at each end of game you will be able to see the following statistics: percentage of wins and distribution of attempts.

**游릴 Share your results of the day on Twitter!** <br>
At the end of each match, a share button will be provided with a sample of your attempts (no spoilers!).

## Next steps

游릳 Maybe I'll add some unit tests in the future...

游릳 And an _about_ page with some math fun facts about the game's odds. 游뱁
